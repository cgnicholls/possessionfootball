# This file implements a simple possession based football drill -- one team
# tries to keep hold of the ball, and is allowed to pass it around, while the
# other team tries to press them and gain possession of the ball.

# First try: the possession team has three players arranged on the vertices of
# an equilateral triangle. If one player is in possession, they choose to pass
# left, right or to hold on to the ball. The ball then travels at some velocity
# in the direction of the player receiving the pass.

# While this is going on, a defender in the middle tries to press the team to
# regain possession. The defender always moves in the direction of the ball, and
# if they get within a certain distance of the ball, they are assumed to have
# won the ball.
